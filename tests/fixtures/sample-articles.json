    "content": "TypeScript generics provide a way to create reusable components that work with multiple types. They allow you to write flexible, type-safe code that can be used across different data types while maintaining strong typing. Generics are denoted using angle brackets and can be applied to functions, classes, and interfaces.",

    "content": "Modern testing approaches go beyond simple unit tests. Integration tests validate entire workflows, end-to-end tests simulate real user scenarios, and property-based testing explores edge cases automatically. The testing pyramid suggests more unit tests at the base, fewer integration tests in the middle, and minimal E2E tests at the top.",
